# Waste-Upcylcling-Potential_Model-Training-and-Evaluation
**Problem Statement:** 
Waste mismanagement continues to be a major issue, particularly in developing regions where large volumes remain unsorted and underutilized.
This leads to significant environmental impacts, including pollution and resource loss.
While AI tools for waste classification exist, they often lack accessibility in low-resource contexts.
This project uses an open-source waste image dataset to train a model for practical, low-cost upcycling potential prediction.
